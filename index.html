                    <li>Heat a stockpot on medium-high heat. Add oil and heat until hot but not smoking.</li>
                    <li>Add the sliced onions and fry for 10-15 minutes or till the onions starts to turn golden brown (be careful not to burn it).</li>

                    <li>Add the cubed beef, pilau masala, beef stock cubes, bay leaves, cilantro, and salt to taste. Cook until the meat browns and caramelizes stirring occasionally about 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add the diced tomatoes and cook for 4-5 minutes, until the tomatoes have released their liquid.</li>
                    <li>Stir in the potatoes and the water. Bring to a boil and cook for 10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Stir in the rice, and cover tightly with a foil paper (to keep the steam in) if necessary. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 20 minutes, until the rice is cooked and the liquid is absorbed.</li>
                    <li>Once the rice is dry, remove the foil paper and fluff with a fork to ensure the seasonings are well distributed all around the rice.</li>
